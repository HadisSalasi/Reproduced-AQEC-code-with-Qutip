# Kerr Parametric Oscillator Simulation with Autonomous Quantum Error Correction (AQEC)
This project simulates the time evolution of a Kerr Parametric Oscillator (KPO) coupled to an ancilla qubit by Hadis Salasi. It models the population dynamics between logical qubit states and demonstrates Autonomous quantum error correction using a driven-dissipative approach.

## üß© Features

- Constructs logical qubit states (`|0‚ü©_L` and `|1‚ü©_L`) in a 16-dimensional Fock space.
- Models the full Hamiltonian, including:
  - Kerr nonlinearity,
  - Four-photon driving,
  - Coupling to ancilla with time-dependent interaction.
- Solves the Lindblad master equation using QuTiP's `mesolve`.
- Calculates fidelities to track population transfer and error correction performance.
- Plots the populations over time.

## üõ† Requirements

Install the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib qutip pandas scipy


## üöÄ How to Run
Run the script directly:
python simulation.py

## üìà Output

Plot: Population dynamics

## üìö Model Description

Operators:

a: annihilation operator for KPO mode,

b: annihilation operator for ancilla qubit.

Hamiltonian:

Kerr nonlinearity,

Detunings (DeltaKPO, DeltaAnc),

Four-photon pump (P),

Ancilla coupling with time-dependent coefficient.

Dissipation:
